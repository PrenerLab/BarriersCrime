## Instructions for Intersection Data

In our crime data, a number of crimes do not have any spatial information except for the intersection where each crime occurred. We'd like to use that intersection to derive x y coordinates so that the crimes can be mapped.  

### Instructions:

1. Open your intersection CSV file and side-scroll until you see the "street1" and "street2" columns. Together, the streets in these two columns should represent an intersection.

2. If the street names are useable (make up a valid intersection), put a 1 in the "useable" column and proceed to step three. If the street names do not make up a valid intersection, put a 0 in the "useable" column and move on to the next intersection.

3. Go to this website: https://www.gps-latitude-longitude.com/address-to-longitude-latitude-gps-coordinates and type the intersection into the search bar. The format of the search should be: "Street1 and Street2".

4. When you locate the appropriate intersection on the map, copy and paste the x coordinates in the "xcoord" column and the y coordinates in the "ycoord" column. 


Lastly, if you have any questions, just ask in the barriers-crime channel on Slack!
